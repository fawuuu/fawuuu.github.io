I am a final year PhD student at the University of Oxford in Computational Statistics supervised by Professor Patrick Rebeschini. Before my PhD, I did my MSc in Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and BSc in Mathematics and BSc in Economics both at the University of Bonn.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, probability and optimization. I am particularly interested in desgning and investigating the statistical properties of computationally efficient algorithms for high-dimensional models in machine learning. 

Software for published work can be found on [[github](https://github.com/fawuuu)].

My resésumé is available [[here](https://fawuuu.github.io/files/cv_fanwu.pdf)].
